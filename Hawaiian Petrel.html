        <p>The Hawaiian Petrel is a seabird endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is known for its long wings and distinctive flight pattern over the ocean.</p>
        <p>These petrels nest in burrows on high mountain slopes and spend most of their lives at sea. They are threatened by introduced predators and light pollution that disorients fledglings.</p>
