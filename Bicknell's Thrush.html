        <p>Bicknell's Thrush is a small songbird that breeds in high-elevation forests of the northeastern United States and Canada. It is known for its distinctive flute-like song and preference for dense coniferous forests.</p>
        <p>These thrushes are highly vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss. They winter in the Caribbean and are threatened by deforestation in both their breeding and wintering grounds.</p>
