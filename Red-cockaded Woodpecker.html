        <p>The Red-cockaded Woodpecker is a small woodpecker found in pine forests of the southeastern United States. It is known for its distinctive black and white barred back and small red streak on the male's head.</p>
        <p>These woodpeckers are threatened by habitat loss and require mature pine forests for nesting. Conservation efforts focus on maintaining suitable forest habitat and creating artificial cavities.</p>
