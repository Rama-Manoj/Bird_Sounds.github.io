        <p>The California Gnatcatcher is a small songbird found in coastal sage scrub habitats of California and Baja California. It is known for its distinctive mewing call and active foraging behavior.</p>
        <p>These gnatcatchers are highly dependent on coastal sage scrub habitat, which has been significantly reduced by urban development. They are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
