        <p>The New Zealand Rockwren is a small, alpine bird endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. It is known for its olive-green plumage, short tail, and distinctive bobbing behavior as it hops among rocks.</p>
        <p>These birds are the only true alpine passerines in New Zealand, living year-round in high-altitude areas. They are threatened by introduced predators and climate change, with conservation efforts focusing on predator control and monitoring their alpine habitats.</p>
