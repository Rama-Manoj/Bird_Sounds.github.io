        <p>The Weka is a flightless rail endemic to New Zealand. It is known for its brown plumage, strong legs, and curious, opportunistic behavior.</p>
        <p>These birds inhabit forests, grasslands, and coastal areas, where they feed on a variety of plant and animal matter. They are threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, with conservation efforts focusing on predator control and habitat protection.</p>
