        <p>The Long-tailed Cuckoo is a bird species native to New Zealand. It is known for its long tail and secretive nature. Despite being a cuckoo, it does not lay its eggs in the nests of other birds.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Long-tailed Cuckoo lays its eggs in the nests of Grey Warblers. The eggs of the cuckoo often mimic those of the warbler, allowing them to be accepted and raised by the warbler parents. The Long-tailed Cuckoo migrates to the Pacific Islands during the New Zealand winter.</p>
