        <p>The Loggerhead Shrike is a predatory songbird found across North America. It is known for its distinctive black mask and habit of impaling prey on thorns or barbed wire.</p>
        <p>These shrikes inhabit open areas with scattered trees and shrubs. They are threatened by habitat loss and pesticide use, which reduces their prey base.</p>
