        <p>The South Island Saddleback is a rare bird endemic to New Zealand's South Island. It is known for its distinctive chestnut saddle marking and wattles on its face.</p>
        <p>These birds inhabit native forests and feed on insects and fruits. They are threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, with conservation efforts focusing on predator control and translocation to predator-free islands.</p>
