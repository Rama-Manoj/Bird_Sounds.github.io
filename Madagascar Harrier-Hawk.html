        <p>The Madagascar Harrier-Hawk is a unique raptor endemic to Madagascar. It is known for its distinctive double-jointed legs, which allow it to reach into tree cavities and crevices to extract prey.</p>
        <p>These hawks inhabit forests and woodlands across Madagascar, where they feed on small vertebrates and invertebrates. They are threatened by habitat loss and hunting, with conservation efforts focusing on protecting their forest habitats and reducing human persecution.</p>
