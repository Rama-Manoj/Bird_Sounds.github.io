        <p>The Kākāpō is a critically endangered, flightless parrot endemic to New Zealand. It is known for its nocturnal habits, moss-green plumage, and distinctive owl-like face.</p>
        <p>These unique parrots inhabit forests and feed on native plants. They are threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, with intensive conservation efforts including predator control and breeding programs helping to slowly increase their numbers.</p>
