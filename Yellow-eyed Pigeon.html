        <p>The Yellow-eyed Pigeon is a migratory pigeon species found in Central Asia and northern India. It is recognized by its yellow eyes and pale plumage.</p>
        <p>These pigeons inhabit open country and agricultural fields, and their populations are declining due to hunting and habitat loss. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their wintering and breeding grounds.</p>
