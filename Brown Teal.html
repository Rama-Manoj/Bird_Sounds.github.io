        <p>The Brown Teal, also known as the PƒÅteke, is a species of dabbling duck endemic to New Zealand. It is characterized by its mottled brown plumage, short bill, and distinctive blue wing patches.</p>
        <p>Once widespread across New Zealand, the Brown Teal is now considered endangered due to habitat loss and predation by introduced mammals. Conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and predator control, aim to protect and increase their population numbers.</p>
