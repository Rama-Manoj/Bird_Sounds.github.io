        <p>The Black-billed Gull, also known as the Tarāpuka, is a native bird species of New Zealand. It is distinguished by its black bill and pale plumage, with adults having a pinkish tinge during breeding season.</p>
        <p>These gulls primarily inhabit riverbeds, lakeshores, and estuaries, where they feed on insects, fish, and marine invertebrates. They are classified as a threatened species due to habitat loss and predation by introduced mammals.</p>
