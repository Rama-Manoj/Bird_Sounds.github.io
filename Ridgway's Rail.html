        <p>Ridgway's Rail is a secretive marsh bird found in California and Mexico. It is known for its distinctive "kek-kek-kek" call and preference for dense marsh vegetation.</p>
        <p>These rails inhabit coastal salt marshes and are highly dependent on healthy marsh ecosystems. They are threatened by habitat loss and degradation of their marsh habitats.</p>
