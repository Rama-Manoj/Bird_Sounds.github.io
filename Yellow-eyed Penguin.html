        <p>The Yellow-eyed Penguin is a rare penguin species endemic to New Zealand. It is known for its distinctive yellow eyes and yellow head band, making it one of the most unique penguin species.</p>
        <p>These penguins inhabit coastal forests and are highly sensitive to human disturbance. They are considered endangered due to habitat loss, predation by introduced mammals, and climate change impacts on their marine food sources.</p>
