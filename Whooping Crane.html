        <p>The Whooping Crane is one of North America's most endangered birds. It is known for its distinctive whooping call and striking white plumage.</p>
        <p>These cranes breed in Canada and winter in Texas. Conservation efforts have helped increase their population from just 15 birds in 1941 to over 800 today.</p>
