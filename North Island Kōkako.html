        <p>The North Island Kōkako is a rare and iconic songbird endemic to New Zealand. It is known for its slate-grey plumage, blue wattles, and haunting, organ-like song.</p>
        <p>These birds inhabit mature native forests, where they feed on leaves, fruit, and invertebrates. They are threatened by habitat loss and introduced predators, with conservation efforts focusing on intensive management and translocation to predator-free areas.</p>
