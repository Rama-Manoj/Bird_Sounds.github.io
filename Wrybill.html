        <p>The Wrybill is a small shorebird endemic to New Zealand. It is known for its unique bill that curves to the right, allowing it to feed on invertebrates under stones.</p>
        <p>These birds inhabit braided riverbeds and coastal areas, where they feed on insects and small invertebrates. They are threatened by habitat loss and introduced predators, with conservation efforts focusing on protecting breeding sites and monitoring populations.</p>
