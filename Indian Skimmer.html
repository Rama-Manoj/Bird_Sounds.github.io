        <p>The Indian Skimmer is a distinctive waterbird found in South Asia. It is known for its unique lower mandible that is longer than the upper one, allowing it to skim the water surface while feeding.</p>
        <p>These birds inhabit large rivers and lakes, where they feed on fish and aquatic insects. They are threatened by habitat loss and disturbance, with conservation efforts focusing on protecting their breeding colonies and maintaining river flow regimes.</p>
